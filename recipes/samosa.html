        <h1> Samosa</h1>
        <img src = "../image/samosa.jpg" alt = "Samosa">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The samosa is prepared with an all-purpose flour (locally known as maida) and stuffed with a filling, often a mixture of diced and cooked or 
            mashed boiled potato (preferably diced), onions, green peas, lentils, ginger, spices and green chili.
            A samosa can be vegetarian or non-vegetarian, depending on the filling. The entire pastry is deep-fried in vegetable oil or rarely ghee to a golden brown.
            It is served hot, often with fresh green chutney, such as mint, coriander, or tamarind. It can also be prepared in a sweet form. Samosas are often served in chaat, along with the traditional accompaniments of either a chickpea
            or a white pea preparation, served with yogurt, tamarind paste and green chutney, garnished with chopped onions, coriander, and chaat masala.
